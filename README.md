Password Generator

Description: A password is randomly generated based on the criteria that the user provides

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first prompted for password length. If outside the range of 8-128, the user is prompted to once again enter a password length within the range. The user is then prompted to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.
